# Bungee Rust Wrapper Project Progress

## Why CXX?

We chose `cxx` for creating Rust bindings for the Bungee C++ library for several key reasons:

1. **Modern C++ Support**
   - Bungee uses modern C++ features including templates and classes
   - `cxx` provides direct C++ feature support without requiring a C intermediate layer
   - Zero-cost abstractions over C++ code

2. **Safety Guarantees**
   - Compile-time type checking across language boundaries
   - Prevention of common FFI pitfalls
   - Automatic ABI compatibility handling
   - No unsafe raw pointer manipulation needed

3. **Specific Advantages for Bungee**
   - Can handle templated `Stretcher<Basic>` class properly
   - Built-in support for C++ standard library types
   - Safe audio buffer handling across FFI boundary

## Action Plan

1. **Initial Setup**
   - [x] Create new Rust project
   - [x] Add cxx dependencies
   - [x] Setup CMake integration for Bungee

2. **Core Bindings**
   - [x] Create initial cxx::bridge module
   - [x] Define shared structs (Request, InputChunk, OutputChunk)
   - [x] Setup Stretcher class bindings
   - [x] Implement audio buffer handling

3. **Safety Layer**
   - [x] Add safe Rust wrapper types
   - [x] Implement state mutation handling with Pin<&mut>
   - [x] Align const-correctness between C++ and Rust
   - [ ] Add error handling

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Basic functionality tests
   - [ ] Audio processing tests
   - [ ] Memory safety tests

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] Document architectural decisions
   - [x] Track error resolution in bug.md
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Usage examples

## Current Status

Core functionality implemented with the following key decisions:

1. **State Mutation Handling**
   - Moving to shared_ptr based approach for better const-correctness
   - Aligning with CXX's recommended patterns
   - Simplifying state management across FFI boundary

2. **Type Safety**
   - Shared structs defined in Rust and exposed to C++
   - Proper type conversions between Bungee and Rust types
   - Safe audio buffer handling with rust::Slice

3. **Architecture**
   - Direct wrapper of Bungee::Stretcher<Basic>
   - Maintaining original library semantics
   - Clear separation of concerns between layers

## Next Steps

1. **Const-Correctness Resolution**
   - Implement shared_ptr wrapper solution
   - Update bridge declarations
   - Adjust wrapper implementation

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add recovery strategies
   - Add debug logging options

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Setup unit test framework
   - Add integration tests
   - Implement audio processing tests

4. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document safety considerations

## Known Issues

Currently addressing const-correctness mismatch between C++ and Rust - solution identified and implementation in progress.
