# Bungee FFI Implementation Progress

## Overview
The primary goal is to enable Rust to call the Bungee audio time-stretching library effectively and safely.
This requires implementing a pure C FFI layer that can be called from Rust, along with safe Rust bindings
that provide an idiomatic API. The C layer serves as a bridge between Rust and the underlying Bungee functionality.

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✓ Pure C implementation without C++ dependencies
- ✓ Basic grain-based time-stretching functionality
- ✓ Memory safety with explicit malloc/free
- ✓ Error handling using return codes
- ✓ Documentation with C-style comments
- ✓ CMake build system configured for C
- ✓ Window function implementation
- ✓ Basic buffer management
- ✓ Successful compilation with pure C compiler
- ✓ Removed all C++ source files and headers
- ✓ Generated static library (libbungee_c.a)
- ✓ Comprehensive debug logging
- ✓ Safe Rust FFI bindings
- ✓ Basic test infrastructure

### Critical Issues
1. Zero Output Samples
   - Audio processing produces no output
   - Debug logging added but issue persists
   - Need to verify grain processing chain

2. Buffer Management
   - Need to validate buffer sizes
   - Verify memory alignment
   - Check for buffer overflows

3. Audio Processing
   - Time-stretching calculation needs verification
   - Window function application might be incorrect
   - Channel stride handling needs review

### In Progress
- [ ] Debug zero output samples issue
- [ ] Validate grain processing chain
- [ ] Verify buffer management
- [ ] Test audio processing accuracy
- [ ] Optimize performance

### Next Steps
1. Debug audio processing chain:
   - Add sample value tracking
   - Verify grain boundaries
   - Check window function application
   - Validate time-stretching calculations

2. Improve buffer management:
   - Add buffer bounds checking
   - Verify memory alignment
   - Add overflow protection

3. Add validation:
   - Input/output sample validation
   - Buffer size verification
   - Processing chain verification

## Alignment with Project Goals
1. Pure C FFI: ✓ Achieved
2. Minimal Dependencies: ✓ Achieved
3. Memory Safety: ✓ Basic implementation
4. Error Handling: ✓ Basic implementation
5. Audio Processing: ⚠️ Needs debugging
6. Performance: ⚠️ Not yet optimized

## Known Issues
1. Zero output samples in audio processing
2. Buffer management needs validation
3. Time-stretching calculations need verification
4. Performance optimization needed
5. Need more comprehensive testing

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Debug audio processing chain
2. Add buffer validation
3. Verify time-stretching calculations
4. Add more test cases
5. Implement performance monitoring 

## Current Status
1. **Zero Output Samples**: The main issue is that the audio processing chain is producing zero output samples, despite the input being correctly generated and the library being initialized.
2. **Debugging Efforts**: We've added detailed logging to the synthesis function to track values through the processing chain, but the issue persists.
3. **Grain Processing**: The grain processing loop is running, but no non-zero samples are being produced in the output.

## Next Steps
1. **Verify Grain Specification**: Double-check the grain boundaries calculated in the `bungee_specify_grain` function to ensure they are correct and that the input data is being copied into the internal buffer as expected.
2. **Check Input Data Handling**: Confirm that the input data is correctly copied into the internal buffer and that the window function is applied properly during analysis.
3. **Review Synthesis Logic**: Re-examine the synthesis logic to ensure that the output buffer is being filled with the synthesized audio data and that the time-stretching and pitch-shifting operations are applied correctly.
