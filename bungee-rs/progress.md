- [x] Basic wrapper structure
- [x] Library and binary crate setup
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Tests

## Implementation Status
### Core Features
- [x] Basic Stretcher class wrapper
- [x] Request struct bindings
- [x] InputChunk struct bindings
- [x] OutputChunk struct bindings
- [x] Type conversions between Rust and C++
- [x] M1/Apple Silicon support
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Audio buffer management
- [ ] Sample rate conversion

### Build System
- [x] CMake integration
- [x] CXX build configuration
- [x] M1 architecture flags
- [x] Header management
- [ ] Cross-platform support
- [ ] Release optimization

## Current Focus
1. Getting the basic wrapper working
2. Ensuring type safety between Rust and C++
3. Proper memory management
4. Basic functionality testing

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Add error handling for audio processing
2. [ ] Implement audio buffer management
3. [ ] Add unit tests
4. [ ] Add documentation
5. [ ] Performance optimization

## Known Issues
1. Type conversion overhead between Rust and C++
2. Need to verify memory safety with audio buffers
3. Need to implement proper error handling
4. Need to add comprehensive tests

## Recent Changes
- Restructured project as both library and binary
- Fixed type conversion issues between Rust and C++
- Added proper M1 targeting
- Implemented basic type conversions
- Added Debug trait for Rust types
