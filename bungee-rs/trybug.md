# Bungee Rust Wrapper Troubleshooting Log

## Overview

Despite making significant progress in integrating the Bungee C++ library with Rust using the `cxx` crate, we find ourselves caught in a recurring loop related to **const-correctness** and **ownership semantics**. This document captures the current challenges, proposed solutions, and next steps to break this cycle and advance the project effectively.

## Current Challenges

### 1. **Ownership Management with `shared_ptr` vs `unique_ptr`**
- **Issue**: Utilizing `shared_ptr` in the C++ wrapper introduces type mismatches and complicates ownership semantics with the `cxx` crate, which primarily supports `unique_ptr`.
- **Impact**: Binding errors and increased complexity in managing object lifetimes across Rust and C++ boundaries.

### 2. **Const-Correctness Mismatch**
- **Issue**: C++ methods that modify internal state are non-const, while Rust's `Pin<&mut T>` expects methods to align with these mutability requirements.
- **Impact**: Persistent errors related to method signatures and state modification expectations between Rust and C++.

### 3. **Incomplete Type Definitions**
- **Issue**: Forward declarations of structs in `wrapper.h` without their full definitions in C++ lead to incomplete type errors during compilation.
- **Impact**: Inability to access or modify struct members, hindering functionality and causing build failures.

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. **Transition to `unique_ptr` for Ownership Management**

To align with the `cxx` crate's expectations and simplify ownership semantics:

- **Action**: Replace all instances of `shared_ptr` with `unique_ptr` in both `wrapper.h` and `wrapper.cpp`.
- **Benefits**:
  - Resolves type mismatch issues.
  - Simplifies ownership and lifetime management.
  - Enhances compatibility with the `cxx` crate.

#### **Updated `bungee-rs/wrapper.h`:**
