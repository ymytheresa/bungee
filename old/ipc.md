# IPC vs FFI Analysis for Bungee Integration

## Initial Consideration of IPC
We considered IPC as an alternative to FFI due to FFI complexity, but after analyzing the actual use case, FFI proved more suitable.

## Use Case Analysis
- Audio files are handled by filesystem
- Core interaction is passing simple numeric parameters (pitch, speed, position)
- Heavy lifting (audio processing) happens in C++ library
- Need real-time control of parameters

## IPC Approach (Considered but Not Chosen)
### Pros:
- Clear process boundary
- Better isolation (crashes don't propagate)
- Easier to debug (can monitor communication)
- Simpler implementation
- Can use standard protocols/formats
- Can distribute across machines if needed

### Cons:
- Higher latency due to IPC overhead
- Need to serialize/deserialize data
- Memory copying between processes
- More system resources (two processes)
- Overkill for simple parameter passing

## Why We Chose FFI Instead
1. **Simple Interface**
   - Only passing basic numeric parameters
   - No complex data structures to marshal
   - Direct function calls are more efficient

2. **Real-time Requirements**
   - Lower latency is critical
   - No IPC overhead
   - Direct memory access when needed

3. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Single process
   - No need for serialization
   - No extra memory copying

4. **Implementation Progress**
   - Already have working FFI foundation
   - Core bindings are implemented
   - Just need refinement and optimization

## Potential Future Considerations
If requirements change to need:
- Process isolation
- Network distribution
- Multiple client support
- Cross-machine operation

Then IPC could be reconsidered with:
1. Named pipes
2. Unix domain sockets
3. Shared memory
4. Network protocols

## Simple IPC Protocol Design (For Reference)
```
Commands:
- INIT {sample_rate, channels}
- PROCESS {chunk_data, position, pitch, speed}
- SHUTDOWN

Responses:
- OK {processed_data}
- ERROR {message}
