## Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture
- Direct FFI using cc crate
- Safe Rust wrapper with RAII
- Comprehensive logging with env_logger
- Error handling with custom Error types
- Duration validation and bug reporting
- Command-line interface for testing

### Known Issues
- Processing loop not terminating (possible infinite loop)
- Output duration shorter than expected
- Potential issues with frame calculation in pitch shifting
- Need to verify FFI struct layout matches C++ side
- Need to validate pitch shifting accuracy
- Possible issue with flushed state detection

### Safety Features
- Unsafe code contained in ffi.rs
- RAII for resource management
- Copy and Clone traits for FFI structs
- Proper error propagation
- Input validation for pitch and speed parameters

### Recent Improvements
- Added semitone-based pitch shifting interface
- Implemented duration calculation helpers
- Added automated bug reporting
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Added command-line arguments for testing
- Implemented file-based logging system
- Added detailed state tracking and validation

### Debug Strategy
1. Track state transitions:
   - Monitor flushed state changes
   - Log grain boundaries
   - Validate position updates
2. Verify memory management:
   - Check resource cleanup
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Validate buffer sizes
3. Analyze processing flow:
   - Track chunk processing
   - Monitor frame counts
   - Verify output generation
