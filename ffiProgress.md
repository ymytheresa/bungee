## Next Steps üîÑ

### Phase 1: FFI Validation
1. Verify Memory Layout:
   - [ ] Run size validation tests
   - [ ] Check struct field alignments
   - [ ] Verify parameter passing
   - [ ] Test memory safety

2. Debug FFI Communication:
   - [ ] Monitor parameter values
   - [ ] Track function calls
   - [ ] Validate return values
   - [ ] Check error conditions

### Phase 2: Testing Refinements
1. Quality Verification:
   - [ ] Add frequency analysis for pitch shifting
   - [ ] Implement more comprehensive output validation
   - [ ] Add edge case testing
   - [ ] Verify pitch shifting accuracy

### Phase 3: Real-time Processing

   - [ ] Streaming interface
   - [ ] Latency controls

## Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture
- Direct FFI using cc crate
- Safe Rust wrapper with RAII
- Comprehensive logging with env_logger
- Error handling with custom Error types
- Duration validation and bug reporting
- Command-line interface for testing
- FFI validation and debugging

### Known Issues
- Processing loop not terminating (possible infinite loop)
- Output duration shorter than expected:
  - Target: 30s, Expected: 30s (fixed), Actual: ~7.6s
  - Possible causes:
    - Frame calculation discrepancy
    - Incorrect output buffer handling
    - Potential early termination in processing loop
    - Need to verify frame advancement logic
- Need to verify FFI struct layout matches C++ side
- Need to validate pitch shifting accuracy
- Possible issue with flushed state detection

### Safety Features
- Unsafe code contained in ffi.rs
- RAII for resource management
- Copy and Clone traits for FFI structs
- Proper error propagation
- Input validation for pitch and speed parameters
- FFI struct size validation
- Debug logging for parameter tracking

### Recent Improvements
- Added FFI struct size validation
- Implemented debug logging for FFI calls
- Fixed pitch shifting duration calculation
- Added automated bug reporting
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Added command-line arguments for testing
- Implemented file-based logging system
- Added detailed state tracking and validation

### Debug Strategy
1. Track FFI communication:
   - Monitor struct sizes and layouts
   - Log parameter values
   - Track function call sequence
2. Verify memory management:
   - Check resource cleanup
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Validate buffer sizes
3. Analyze processing flow:
   - Track chunk processing
   - Monitor frame counts
   - Verify output generation

### Recent Findings
- Output duration validation reveals consistent shortfall:
  - Processing completes but generates less output than expected
  - Chunk processing appears normal but output accumulation may be incomplete
  - Frame calculations and buffer handling need review
  - Position advancement logic may need adjustment
  - Zero output frames occurring in some chunks
- Added FFI validation to catch potential memory layout issues
- Implemented comprehensive debug logging for FFI communication
