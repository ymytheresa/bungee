# Bungee FFI Implementation Progress

## Completed ‚úÖ
- Basic FFI setup with direct bindings
- Build system integration (C++20, KissFFT, Eigen)
- Core operations implemented and verified:
  - Creation/destruction
  - Preroll
  - Frame counting
  - State checking
- Core audio methods implemented:
  - specify_grain
  - analyse_grain
  - synthesise_grain
  - next
- Batch processing test framework:
  - Test audio generation
  - Basic processing pipeline
  - Zero-padding for negative indices
  - Output validation

## Current Status ‚è≥
- Batch processing tests running
- Initial audio output verified
- Basic error handling in place
- Logging system operational

## Next Steps üîÑ

### Phase 1: Testing Refinements
1. Quality Verification:
   - [ ] Add frequency analysis for pitch shifting
   - [ ] Implement more comprehensive output validation
   - [ ] Add edge case testing

### Phase 2: Real-time Processing
1. Design real-time wrapper:
   - [ ] Buffer management
   - [ ] Streaming interface
   - [ ] Latency controls

## Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture
- Direct FFI using cc crate
- Safe Rust wrapper with RAII
- Comprehensive logging with env_logger
- Error handling with custom Error types

### Known Issues
- Zero output in audio processing (under investigation)
- Need to verify FFI struct layout matches C++ side

### Safety Features
- Unsafe code contained in ffi.rs
- RAII for resource management
- Copy and Clone traits for FFI structs
- Proper error propagation
