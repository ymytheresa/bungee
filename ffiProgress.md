# Bungee FFI Implementation Progress

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- Basic FFI setup complete with direct bindings
- Build system working (C++20, KissFFT, Eigen)
- Basic operations verified (create, destroy, preroll)
- Initial test framework in place
- Logging system working

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Batch Processing ‚è≥
1. Implement core audio methods:
   - [ ] specify_grain
   - [ ] analyse_grain
   - [ ] synthesise_grain
   - [ ] next
2. Create batch processing test:
   - [ ] Load test audio file
   - [ ] Process entire file
   - [ ] Verify pitch shifting
   - [ ] Add quality checks

### Phase 2: Real-time Processing üîÑ
1. Design real-time wrapper:
   - [ ] Buffer management
   - [ ] Streaming interface
   - [ ] Latency controls
2. Implement real-time features:
   - [ ] Circular buffers
   - [ ] Timing checks
   - [ ] Async processing
   - [ ] Error recovery

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation
- Using direct FFI with cc crate
- C++20 for modern features
- KissFFT for audio processing
- Eigen for matrix operations
- Comprehensive logging

### Known Issues (Non-Critical)
- C/C++ compilation warnings for KissFFT
- All core functionality working despite warnings

### Testing Strategy
1. Basic Operations ‚úÖ
   - Creation/destruction
   - Preroll
   - Frame counting
   - State checking

2. Batch Processing (Next)
   - Simple sine wave test
   - File-based testing
   - Quality verification

3. Real-time Testing (Future)
   - Buffer management
   - Latency measurement
   - Streaming performance
   - Error handling

## Safety and Performance
- All unsafe code contained in ffi.rs
- RAII for resource management
- Error handling in place
- Type safety verified
- Logging for debugging
