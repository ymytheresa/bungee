## Current Status
- Basic FFI bindings defined
- Safe wrapper structure created
- Error handling framework in place
- Comprehensive logging added
- Basic example program created
- Build system fully configured and working:
  - Using C++20 for modern features
  - KissFFT integration working
  - Eigen headers configured
  - All dependencies building successfully
- Basic operations verified:
  - Stretcher lifecycle works
  - Preroll functions correctly
  - Frame count queries work
  - Flush state checks work
- Known minor issues:
  - Some unnecessary unsafe blocks in lib.rs (fixed)
  - Unused warn import (fixed)
  - C/C++ compilation warnings (non-critical)

## Design Decisions

### FFI Implementation Choice
1. Using direct FFI with `cc` crate (not cxx):
   - Direct control over C++ compilation
   - Manual but explicit FFI bindings
   - Full control over memory management
   - Clear visibility of unsafe boundaries
2. Current build.rs has some cxx-like patterns that could be confusing
   - TODO (Low Priority): Clean up build.rs to remove cxx-style remnants
   - For now, focusing on functionality over cleanup

### Why Direct FFI?
1. Matches Bungee's C-style function table interface
2. Complete control over bindings and memory management
3. Simpler debugging (no extra abstraction layer)
4. Clear error messages (direct C++ to Rust mapping)
5. Direct performance (minimal overhead)

### Safety Strategy
1. All unsafe code contained in `ffi.rs` ‚úÖ
2. Safe wrapper types in `lib.rs` ‚úÖ
3. RAII for resource management ‚úÖ
4. Comprehensive error handling framework ‚úÖ
5. Detailed logging for debugging ‚úÖ

### Type Safety
1. Using `NonNull<c_void>` for pointers
2. Proper RAII cleanup in Drop implementation
3. Safe conversion traits between FFI and Rust types
4. Error types for all failure modes
5. Result type for error propagation

## Next Steps
1. Clean up minor code issues:
   - Remove unnecessary unsafe blocks
   - Clean up unused imports
   - Address C/C++ compilation warnings
2. Implement remaining audio processing methods
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Complete documentation

## Implementation Notes

### FFI Design
- Using `repr(C)` for FFI structs
- Function table approach matches original library
- Clear separation between unsafe and safe code

### Safety Considerations
- All raw pointers wrapped in NonNull
- RAII cleanup ensures no resource leaks
- Error handling for all failure modes
- Type conversions handle data correctly
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Build System
- Using cc crate for direct C++ compilation (not cxx)
- C++20 enabled for modern features
- KissFFT integration working correctly
- Eigen headers properly configured
- All dependencies building successfully
- Minor C/C++ warnings to be addressed

### Logging Strategy
- Debug level for detailed operation tracking
- Info level for important state changes
- Error level for failure conditions
- Log messages include relevant context
- Environment-based log level configuration 

### Technical Debt Notes
- Build script contains some cxx-style patterns that should be cleaned up
- Some unnecessary unsafe blocks in lib.rs
- Unused imports to be cleaned up
- C/C++ compilation warnings to be addressed
- All issues are non-critical and can be fixed gradually
